// Coding Challenge #1
// We're building a football betting app (soccer for my American friends ðŸ˜…)!
// Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game ('game' variable on
// next page). In this challenge we're gonna work with that data.
// Your tasks:
'use strict';

const game = {
  team1: 'Bayern Munich',
  team2: 'Borrussia Dortmund',
  players: [
    [
      'Neuer',
      'Pavard',
      'Martinez',
      'Alaba',
      'Davies',
      'Kimmich',
      'Goretzka',
      'Coman',
      'Muller',
      'Gnarby',
      'Lewandowski',
    ],
    [
      'Burki',
      'Schulz',
      'Hummels',
      'Akanji',
      'Hakimi',
      'Weigl',
      'Witsel',
      'Hazard',
      'Brandt',
      'Sancho',
      'Gotze',
    ],
  ],
  score: '4:0',
  scored: ['Lewandowski', 'Gnarby', 'Lewandowski', 'Hummels'],
  date: 'Nov 9th, 2037',
  odds: {
    team1: 1.33,
    x: 3.25,
    team2: 6.5,
  },
  printGoals: function (...playerNames) {
    console.log(...playerNames);
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < playerNames.length; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < this.scored.length; j++) {
        if (playerNames[i] === this.scored[j]) count++;
      }
      console.log(playerNames[i], count++);
      count = 0;
    }
  },
};

// 1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and
// 'players2')
const [players1, players2] = game.players;
console.log(players1, players2);

// 2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field
// players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the
// goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10
// field players
const [gk, ...fieldPlayers] = players1;
console.log(gk, fieldPlayers);

// 3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22
// players)
const allPlayers = [...players1, ...players2];
console.log(allPlayers);

// 4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a
// new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus
// 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'
const players1Final = [...players1, 'Thiago', 'Coutinho', 'Perisic'];
console.log(players1Final);

// 5. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called
// 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
const { team1, x: draw, team2 } = game.odds;
console.log(team1, draw, team2);

// 6. Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player
// names (not an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the
// number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)
// game.printGoals('Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski', 'Kimmich');
// game.printGoals(...game.scored);

// 7. The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the console which
// team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary
// operator.
console.log((team1 < team2 && game.team1) || (team1 > team2 && game.team2));

// Test data for 6.: First, use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'.
// Then, call the function again with players from game.scored

// Coding Challenge #2
// Let's continue with our football betting app! Keep using the 'game' variable from
// before.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the console,
// along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
for (const [goalNumber, player] of game.scored.entries()) {
  console.log(`Goal ${goalNumber + 1}: ${player}`);
}

// 2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console (We already
// studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember)
let avgOdd = 0;
for (const odd of Object.values(game.odds)) avgOdd += odd;
console.log('avgOdd', avgOdd / Object.values(game.odds).length);
// 3. Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exactly like this:
// Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33
// Odd of draw: 3.25
// Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5
// Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them
// (except for "draw"). Hint: Note how the odds and the game objects have the
// same property names ðŸ˜‰
for (const [teamKey, teamOdd] of Object.entries(game.odds)) {
  console.log(`Odd of victory ${game[teamKey] ?? 'draw'}: ${teamOdd}`);
}
// 4. Bonus: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the
// players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value. In this
// game, it will look like this:
// {
// Gnarby: 1,
// Hummels: 1,
// Lewandowski: 2
// }
const scorers = {};
for (const player of game.scored) {
  scorers[player] ? (scorers[player] += 1) : (scorers[player] = 1);
}
console.log(scorers);
