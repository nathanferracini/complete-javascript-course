//Your tasks:
//1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
//2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
//3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team
//as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner
//to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above.
//Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
//4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and
//Data 2
//5. Ignore draws this time
//Test data:
//ยง Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49
//ยง Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27
